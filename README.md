The files here are pretty self explanatory, but just in case. The main one is cbb_team_quiz.html. It's a self-contained webpage that uses jquery to help a user pick a college basketball team to follow based on their style of play. cbb_team_quiz.py is an early Pythonic version of the quiz that ran in the console I used for testing the idea. CBBRootingQuiz.xlsx and .csv are how I pulled together different elements on the KenPom dataset for 2014 to get the right data pieces. get_stat_ranges.py is a simple utility that figures out where to put the breaks for the slider by dividing the college basketball universe into 10 parts with 11 endpoints.
